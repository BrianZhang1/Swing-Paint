## History

Swing Paint began as a school project.
Although I submitted it for my eleventh-grade culminating project, it spawned from my hatred for one of the units during the course: the Graphics unit.
Don't get me wrong, it was easy, but positioning sprites through trial and error of coordinates pushed me to the limits of my sanity.
I created this tool so no student would ever have to suffer through that unit again.

The linked folder includes a project proposal and a development journal from before I moved this project to GitHub.
